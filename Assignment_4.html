		<h3>Summary</h3>
		<p>Speech synthesis is the artificial production of human speech. A computer system used for this 
purpose is called a speech synthesizer, and can be implemented in software or hardware . A 
text-to-speech (TTS) system converts normal language text into speech; other systems render 
symbolic linguistic representations like phonetic transcriptions into speech. Text-to-speech 
(TTS) convention transforms linguistic information stored as data or text into speech. It is 
widely used in audio reading devices for blind people now a days. In the last few years 
however, the use of text-to-speech conversion technology has grown far beyond the disabled 
community to become a major adjunct to the rapidly growing use of digital voice storage for 
voice mail and voice response systems. Also developments in Speech synthesis technology for 
various languages have already taken place</p>

		<h3>Summary</h3>
		<p> There has been a time-consuming problem with the manual system. Apart from that in the 
current system, checking the answer sheets after taking the test, waste of the examiners time, 
so this application will check the correct answer and save the examiner time and carry the 
examination in an effective manner. The current trend of research on Quiz - Builder and 
Solver Application. Several variants of these algorithms have been developed. The current 
research is to study and develop algorithms that will save the time while conducting 
examinations, assist the user to concentrate on their other activities rather than to concentrate 
on record keeping. This project helps the examiners to manage their services in a good way 
and provide a better service to their users.
